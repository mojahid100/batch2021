    text: "A 70-year-old man comes to the office due to persistent epigastric discomfort and nausea for the past several months. He has also noticed black-colored stools on several occasions. Medical history is notable for hypertension and osteoarthritis. The patient emigrated from rural China 5 years ago to live with his daughter. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Physical examination shows a thin male with pale mucous membranes, an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node, and epigastric tenderness on deep palpation. Stool testing for occult blood is positive. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a 3-cm ulceration at the gastric antrum, with a heaped-up irregular border. Biopsy from the edge of the ulcer reveals glandular structures containing intestinal-like columnar cells. Which of the following most likely predisposed this patient to his current condition?",
    choices: [
      "A. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs",
      "B. Excessive consumption of salt-preserved foods",
      "C. Frequent intake of high-temperature beverages",
      "D. Functional disruption of gastroesophageal junction",
      "E. Increased gastrin production from a pancreatic mass"

The patient has no significant medical history and takes no medications. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. The patient immigrated to the United States from China 4 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows mild epigastric tenderness to deep palpation. Laboratory testing demonstrates iron deficiency anemia and the presence of fecal occult blood. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a 1-cm ulcer in the first portion of the duodenum. Additional test results are pending. In addition to proton pump inhibitor therapy, which of the following would be most appropriate to prevent ulcer recurrence based on this patient’s most likely diagnosis?",
