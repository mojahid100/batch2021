    text: "A 46-year-old woman with a history of hiatal hernia and severe gastroesophageal reflux undergoes antireflux surgery. The reflux symptoms were refractory to medical therapy, so an endoscopic fundoplication procedure is performed. During surgery, the hiatal defect is repaired, and the gastric fundus is mobilized and wrapped around the lower esophagus to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter. No esophageal or gastric injuries occurred, but a neural structure traversing the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm was inadvertently injured. Which of the following is the most likely potential effect of this operative injury?",
    choices: [
      "A. Delayed gastric emptying",
      "B. Diaphragmatic paralysis",
      "C. Fecal incontinence",
      "D. Gastric acid hypersecretion",
      "E. Permanent loss of intestinal peristalsis"
    ],
    correct: [0],
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A. Vagal trunk injury during fundoplication causes delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis).",
    details: "A. Correct: Vagal injury impairs gastric motility, causing gastroparesis.\nB. Incorrect: Phrenic nerve, not vagus, innervates diaphragm.\nC. Incorrect: Fecal incontinence involves pelvic splanchnic nerves.\nD. Incorrect: Vagal injury reduces acid secretion.\nE. Incorrect: Enteric system maintains peristalsis."

Medicalneri history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 32 kg/m². Physical examination is unremarkable. Upright chest x-ray shows an opacity with an air-fluid level behind the heart. A subsequent barium swallow reveals the proximal stomach herniating through the esophageal hiatus. Which of the following pathophysiological changes most likely contributed to this patient's current condition?",
    choices: [
      "A. Cephalad migration of the squamocolumnar junction with a fixed gastroesophageal junction",

Three months ago, the patient started having difficulty swallowing large bites of solid food, and now he can swallow only liquids and mashed food. He has lost 9.1 kg (20 lb) since the onset of his symptoms. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. The patient recently reduced the doses of his diabetic medications due to weight loss and lower blood glucose levels. He has no recent travel outside of the United States. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 29 kg/m2. Physical examination is normal. A barium swallow study reveals an esophageal mass that significantly narrows the lumen. Endoscopic biopsy reveals moderately differentiated tumor cells with keratin nests and pearls. This patient's condition is most likely related to which of the following risk factors?",
